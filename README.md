# Office File Local Viewer For Web
Simplify office local file viewing

# Use case
As you may know, the google docs is working good in most case. However, if you run it on localhost, it won't work. This code is used to transload file from your localhost to dropbox server, then share the link, lastly, put the link to google docs, so you could view office file on your page.
Well, anyway, it'll require Internet to work as you still have to connect to dropbox & google docs (in background).

# Programming Language: Javascript, HTML
Using Javascript to transload file from local server to dropbox, then show it on HTML page through an iFrame to google docs api.

# Setup:
Just put in your own Dropbox API, then the module is ready to go

# Deploy:
You should move the javascript part to .js file, which easier for reuse in further needed.

# 3rd party modules:
- Dropbox API Javascript from Dropbox.com
- jQuery from jQuery.com
- ajaxTransport from jQuery.com & http://www.henryalgus.com/reading-binary-files-using-jquery-ajax/
- Demo docx file from https://calibre-ebook.com/downloads/demos/demo.docx
- Google docs file viewer from Google (don't you know google? I mean Google, or maybe GOOGLE - just jk)
